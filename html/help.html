            <h1>Help</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll
                provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
                What is Join?
                Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
                guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.
                How to use it
                Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:
                1.
                Exploring the Board
                When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains
                four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                2.
                Creating Contacts
                In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
                "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
                and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                3.
                Adding Cards
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card,
                like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                4.
                Moving Cards
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
                the card from one list to another.
                5.
                Deleting Cards
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
                irreversible.

                Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
                board reflects the current state of your project.
